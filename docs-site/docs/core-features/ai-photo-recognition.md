# AI Photo Recognition

MovingBox's AI Photo Recognition is the core technology that makes documenting your belongings quick and effortless.

## How It Works

When you take a photo of an item, our AI:

1. **Analyzes the image** to identify the object
2. **Recognizes the item type** (furniture, electronics, clothing, etc.)
3. **Extracts key details** such as brand, model, color, and approximate dimensions
4. **Estimates value** based on similar items in our database
5. **Suggests categories** for organization

All of this happens in seconds, saving you the time and effort of manual data entry.

## Taking Optimal Photos

For best results when using the AI recognition:

- **Good lighting**: Ensure the item is well-lit
- **Clear view**: Capture the entire item in frame
- **Minimal background clutter**: Isolate the item when possible
- **Multiple angles**: For complex items, take photos from different angles

## Recognition Capabilities

Our AI can recognize thousands of common household items, including:

- Furniture (sofas, tables, chairs, beds)
- Electronics (TVs, computers, phones, appliances)
- Kitchen items (utensils, appliances, dishware)
- Clothing and accessories
- Books, media, and collectibles
- Tools and equipment
- Art and decor

## Reviewing AI Results

After the AI processes your photo:

1. Review the suggested item name and description
2. Check the category assignment
3. Verify the estimated value
4. Add or modify details as needed

## Continuous Learning

Our AI system improves over time:

- Each new photo helps train the system
- Regular updates enhance recognition accuracy
- User corrections teach the system to make better identifications

## Privacy & Data Security

Your privacy is important to us:

- All image processing happens securely in the cloud
- Photos are encrypted during transmission
- We never share your photos with third parties
- You can delete photos from our servers at any time
