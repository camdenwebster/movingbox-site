# Value Estimation

MovingBox helps you track the value of your belongings with AI-powered estimation tools that provide approximate values for your items.

## How Value Estimation Works

When you add an item to MovingBox, the app uses several data points to estimate its value:

1. **Visual Recognition**: AI identifies the item type, brand, and model
2. **Market Database**: Compares with current market prices for similar items
3. **Condition Assessment**: Adjusts value based on the condition you select
4. **Depreciation Models**: Considers age and typical depreciation rates

## Value Types

MovingBox tracks several types of values for each item:

- **Estimated Current Value**: The approximate current market value
- **Purchase Price**: What you originally paid (if provided)
- **Replacement Cost**: What it would cost to replace the item new
- **Insurance Value**: Value for insurance coverage purposes

## Providing Additional Value Information

For more accurate valuations:

1. When adding or editing an item, go to the "Value" section
2. Enter the purchase price if you know it
3. Select the date of purchase
4. Upload receipts or proof of purchase (Pro feature)
5. Add any professional appraisals (ideal for high-value items)

## Value Accuracy

The accuracy of value estimates depends on several factors:

- **Common Items**: Everyday objects like electronics have more accurate estimates
- **Unique Items**: Rare or custom items may need manual valuation
- **Condition Details**: More detailed condition information improves accuracy
- **Supporting Documentation**: Adding receipts improves valuation accuracy

## Value Reports

MovingBox can generate value reports for your inventory:

1. Go to the Reports section
2. Select "Value Report"
3. Choose categories or items to include
4. Select the value type (current, replacement, insurance)
5. Generate and export the report
