# Moving Preparation

MovingBox simplifies the moving process by helping you inventory, organize, and track your belongings during relocation.

## Before Your Move

Start preparing for your move with these steps:

1. **Complete your inventory**: Document all items you plan to move
2. **Create moving-specific tags**: Tag items with their destination in the new home
3. **Identify fragile items**: Add "Fragile" tags to items needing special care
4. **Mark items to sell/donate**: Use tags to identify items you won't be moving
5. **Organize by room/area**: Group items by their current location

## Creating a Moving Plan

MovingBox helps you develop a comprehensive moving strategy:

1. Go to **Reports** in the app menu
2. Select **Moving Plan Report**
3. Choose which locations and items to include
4. Generate a room-by-room moving checklist
5. Share with family members or moving companies

## Box Inventory System

Keep track of packed items with the box inventory feature:

1. Create a new "Box" location (e.g., "Box 1 - Kitchen")
2. As you pack items, update their location to the appropriate box
3. Add a photo of the packed box (optional)
4. Print box labels with QR codes that link to the box contents (Pro feature)

## Value Protection

Ensure proper insurance coverage during your move:

1. Use the **Value Report** to determine the total value of items being moved
2. Compare with moving company insurance coverage
3. Consider supplemental moving insurance for high-value items
4. Document condition of valuable items before packing

## During the Move

Stay organized during the moving process:

1. Use the **Box Tracking** feature to monitor which boxes are loaded/unloaded
2. Scan box QR codes to quickly see contents (Pro feature)
3. Update item locations as boxes are delivered to rooms
4. Mark boxes as "Unpacked" as you settle into your new home

## After the Move

Once you've arrived at your new home:

1. Update locations for all items based on their new placement
2. Add new rooms or storage areas specific to your new home
3. Identify any missing or damaged items
4. Create a "Still to Purchase" collection for items you need
5. Update your home inventory for insurance at your new address

## Moving Company Integration

1. Share specific inventory reports with moving companies
2. Track moving company handling of specific boxes or items
3. Document condition before and after the move
4. Generate detailed reports for any damage claims
