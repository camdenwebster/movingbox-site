## General Questions

::: details What is MovingBox?
MovingBox is an AI-powered home inventory app that helps you document, organize, and manage your belongings. Using advanced artificial intelligence, MovingBox can identify items from photos, automatically document their details, and help you organize your inventory by location and labels.

Currently, MovingBox is only available for iOS devices. We're evaluating an Android version for the future, but there's no release timeline yet. Sign up for our newsletter on our website to be notified if an Android version becomes available.

## AI Features

::: details How accurate is the AI recognition?
Our AI system has a general item identification accuracy rate of over 90% for common household items. Brand/model recognition is approximately 80% accurate when branding is visible. The AI continues to improve over time as our models are updated.

For critical items (especially valuable ones), we recommend reviewing the AI-generated information for accuracy.
:::

::: details Does the app store my photos?
No, MovingBox does not store your photos on our servers. When you use the AI recognition feature, your photos are securely processed and immediately deleted after analysis. The only photos stored are those you choose to save as part of your item records, which are stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account if cloud backup is enabled.
:::

::: details Why didn't the AI correctly identify my item?
While our AI is quite advanced, it may struggle with:

- Items in poor lighting conditions
- Very unusual or unique items
- Items where key identifying features are obscured
- Very new products that weren't in the training data

For best results, take photos in good lighting with the item clearly visible. You can always manually edit any details the AI doesn't get right.
:::

::: details How does the value estimation work?
Value estimates are generated based on current market data for similar items. These estimates are approximate and may not reflect the exact value of your specific item, especially for rare, antique, or limited edition items. For insurance purposes, consider getting professional appraisals for high-value items.
:::

## Data Management

::: details How do I back up my inventory?
MovingBox uses iCloud backup to automatically sync your data across all your iOS devices signed in with the same Apple ID.
:::

::: details Can I transfer my inventory to a new phone?
Yes! Simply install MovingBox on your new device and sign in with the same Apple ID. Your inventory will sync automatically through iCloud.
:::

::: details Is there a limit to how many items I can add?
You can add an unlimited number of items in both free and premium plans. However, free users are limited to 50 AI image analyses. After using all 50 AI analyses, you can still manually add and edit as many items as you want.
:::

::: details How do I delete my data?
