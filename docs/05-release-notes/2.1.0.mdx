**Released:** December 2024

MovingBox 2.1.0 introduces powerful new capabilities that make cataloging your home inventory faster and more efficient than ever. This update features intelligent multi-item detection, an enhanced navigation experience for larger screens, and numerous quality improvements.

## Features

### Multi-Item Analysis from a Single Photo

Save time cataloging your belongings with our intelligent multi-item detection system. Take one photo and identify multiple items at once—perfect for shelves, cabinets, or any space with multiple items.

**How it works:**
- Capture a photo containing multiple items
- Our AI automatically identifies each individual item
- Review and edit the detected items
- Add them all to your inventory with one tap

This feature dramatically reduces the time needed to catalog rooms with many items, turning what used to take dozens of photos into just a few.

### Completely Redesigned Import & Export Experience

We've rebuilt the import and export functionality from the ground up to give you complete control and visibility over your data.

**Enhanced Import:**
- Preview before importing to see exactly what will be imported and choose what to keep
- Real-time progress tracking with detailed progress indicators
- Success celebration screen with confetti animation when your import completes
- Clear, human-readable error messages that explain what happened and how to fix it

**Improved Export:**
- Visual progress feedback as your export is prepared in real-time
- Streamlined sharing via email, cloud storage, or any other app
- Enhanced reliability for handling large inventories

### Optimized Navigation for iPad and Mac

For iPad and Mac Catalyst users, we've introduced a beautiful new split-view interface that makes the most of larger screens.

**What's new:**
- Sidebar navigation for quick access to all your locations and collections
- Multi-column layout to view your list and details side-by-side
- Better use of screen space with familiar navigation patterns
- Automatic adaptation between phone-optimized (iPhone) and desktop-class (iPad/Mac) interfaces

### Pre-Populated Default Rooms

New users will find their home pre-populated with common rooms like Kitchen, Living Room, Bedroom, and Bathroom. Each room comes with a beautiful SF Symbol icon, making it easier to visualize and organize your space from day one.

### Enhanced Sorting Options

New sorting capabilities let you view your items exactly how you want:
- Sort by name, date added, location, or value
- Toggle between ascending and descending order
- Persistent sort preferences across sessions

### Improved Onboarding Experience

We've added an optional survey during onboarding to better understand how you plan to use MovingBox—whether for moving preparation, insurance documentation, home inventory management, estate planning, or other purposes. Your feedback helps us prioritize features that matter most.

### In-App Feature Discovery

The new "What's New" screen automatically highlights new features when you update the app. Access it anytime from Settings → About → What's New to review the latest improvements.
