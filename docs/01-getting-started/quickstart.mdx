## App Onboarding Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Welcome Screen">
    Open the app and tap the "Get Started" button to begin
    
    <Note>
      There might be a slight delay after tapping the button as MovingBox enables iCloud, checks for existing inventory data, and restores subscription purchases in the background.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Your First Item">
    - Take a photo of an item (or items) in your home
    - Wait briefly while AI analyzes the image
    - Review and adjust the AI-generated details if needed
    - If the photo contains multiple items, our AI will detect each one separately
    - Tap "Save" to add the item(s) to your inventory
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Notifications">
    Choose whether to allow notifications from MovingBox
    
    <Tip>
      Notifications can alert you about special occurrences such as insurance policy expiration, warranty expiration, exceeding insurance policy limits, and more. Not all notification features have been implemented yet.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Setup">
    Onboarding is now complete! You can now access the main app and continue adding locations and items to build your home inventory.
