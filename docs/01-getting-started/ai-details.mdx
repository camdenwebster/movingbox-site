MovingBox leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence powered by OpenAI Vision to transform the way you create and maintain your home inventory. Here's how our AI technology works and the benefits it provides.

## How Our AI Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Image Capture">
    When you take a photo of an item, MovingBox captures a high-quality image while optimizing for lighting and focus.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Image Processing">
    For standard users, images are resized to 512x512 pixels for efficient processing. MovingBox Pro users benefit from high-resolution processing up to 1250x1250 pixels for enhanced detail recognition.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Object Recognition">
    OpenAI's model identifies the object, its category, brand, model, and physical characteristics with remarkable accuracy.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Extraction">
    The system extracts relevant information such as serial numbers, model numbers, and other identifying features when visible.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Value Estimation">
    For many common items, our AI can provide an approximate market value based on current market data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Photos are processed in real-time and immediately deleted after analysis, ensuring your privacy and data security.

## OpenAI Model and Processing

MovingBox 2.0 uses different OpenAI models based on your subscription:
- **Standard users**: OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model for high-quality image analysis
- **MovingBox Pro users**: OpenAI's `gpt-5-mini` model for the most advanced recognition capabilities

During our testing, we found these models provide excellent recognition accuracy with optimized processing times.

## Recognition Accuracy
<Warning>
  While we have found OpenAI Vision to be highly accurate from our testing, we recommend reviewing AI-generated information for critical items, especially for insurance or valuation purposes. Generative AI can always make mistakes.
</Warning>

## Privacy and Security

We take your privacy seriously:

- **No Image Storage**: Your photos are processed and then immediately deleted
- **Secure Processing**: All data transmission uses end-to-end encryption
- **Anonymous Analysis**: No personally identifiable information is associated with AI processing

For more information, please review our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).
