## Best Practices for Organization

<Accordion title="Create a Consistent Structure">
  Develop a logical organization system and stick to it. For example, use locations for physical placement and labels for item categorization or status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Start Simple">
  Begin with basic locations like rooms to organize your inventory effectively.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Multi-Item Detection for Faster Organization">
  When cataloging items in a specific location, take photos of shelves, cabinets, or surfaces with multiple items. Our multi-item detection will identify each item separately, making it faster to build your inventory while maintaining proper location assignments.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Purpose-Driven Labels">
  Since you can only assign one label per item, choose your labels carefully based on your most important organizational needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Regular Maintenance">
  Review your organizational system periodically and update it as your needs change. Remove unused labels and consider reorganizing as your collection grows.
