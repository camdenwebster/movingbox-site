description: "Learn how to backup, export, and import your MovingBox inventory data"
---

This guide covers how to export your inventory data for backup or sharing purposes, and how to import data back into MovingBox.

## Understanding Import & Export

MovingBox's import/export feature allows you to:

- **Create backups** of your entire inventory including photos
- **Transfer data** between devices or to other applications
- **Share inventory lists** with moving companies, insurance providers, or family members
- **Selectively export** specific items for focused reports

### Export Format

When you export data, MovingBox creates a ZIP archive containing:

- **inventory.csv** - Your items with all properties (title, description, quantity, price, serial numbers, etc.)
- **locations.csv** - All your locations with descriptions
- **labels.csv** - All your labels with colors and emojis
- **photos/** folder - All photos associated with your items and locations

<Note>
  Exports are in standard CSV format, making them compatible with spreadsheet applications like Excel, Google Sheets, and Numbers.
</Note>

## Exporting Your Data

### Exporting All Inventory

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Navigate to the Settings tab from the bottom navigation bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Export Data">
    Scroll down and tap "Export Data" in the Data Management section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose What to Export">
    Select which types of data to include in your export:
    - **Export Items** - Include all your inventory items
    - **Export Locations** - Include all locations
    - **Export Labels** - Include all labels

    <Tip>
      Toggle on only what you need. For example, if you only want to share your items list without locations, turn off "Export Locations" and "Export Labels"
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Export">
    Tap the green "Export Data" button to begin the export process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share or Save">
    Once the export is complete, use the share sheet to:
    - Save to Files app for local backup
    - Upload to cloud storage (iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
    - Email to yourself or others
    - Share via AirDrop
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Exporting Selected Items

You can export specific items directly from your inventory list:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Inventory List">
    Navigate to your items list view
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Selection Mode">
    Tap the selection icon (circle with checkmark) in the toolbar to enable multi-select mode
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Items">
    Tap on each item you want to export to select them
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export Selection">
    Tap the export button in the toolbar to create a ZIP file containing only the selected items

    <Note>
      When exporting selected items, all locations and labels are included to maintain data relationships
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Your Export">
    Use the share sheet to save or send your selective export
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Importing Data

<Warning>
  The import process **does not check for duplicates**. Importing the same file multiple times will create duplicate items, locations, and labels in your inventory.
</Warning>

### Importing from a Backup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Navigate to the Settings tab from the bottom navigation bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Import Data">
    Scroll down and tap "Import Data" in the Data Management section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose What to Import">
    Select which types of data to import:
    - **Import Items** - Restore your inventory items
    - **Import Locations** - Restore locations
    - **Import Labels** - Restore labels

    <Tip>
      If you only want to import locations from another inventory without adding the items, toggle off "Import Items" and keep only "Import Locations" enabled
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Warning">
    Read the duplicate data warning carefully and tap "Continue" if you're ready to proceed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select ZIP File">
    Choose the MovingBox export ZIP file from your device:
    - Files app
    - iCloud Drive
    - Downloads folder
    - Any other accessible location
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    The import process will show progress as it:
    - Extracts the ZIP file
    - Imports locations and labels first
    - Imports items with their relationships
    - Copies photos to your device
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    When complete, you'll see a summary showing:
    - Number of items imported
    - Number of locations imported
    - Number of labels imported
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Backups">
    Export your inventory regularly, especially:
    - After adding many new items
    - Before major updates to the app
    - Before switching devices
    - At least monthly for peace of mind

    Store backups in multiple locations (cloud storage + local) for redundancy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Organized Export Files">
    Name your export files descriptively with dates:
    - `MovingBox-Full-Backup-2025-01-15.zip`
    - `MovingBox-Garage-Items-2025-01-15.zip`

    The app automatically includes timestamps, but you can rename files after exporting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Avoiding Duplicates">
    Since imports don't check for duplicates:
    - Keep track of what you've already imported
    - Delete old data before re-importing if needed
    - Use selective exports to avoid importing everything multiple times
    - Consider creating a test inventory to preview imports
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sharing with Others">
    When sharing inventory data:
    - Export only what's necessary (use toggles to exclude sensitive data)
    - Remove personal notes or sensitive information before exporting if needed
    - Remember that photos are included in exports
    - Consider selective exports for sharing specific rooms or categories
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Compatibility & Limitations

### What Can Be Imported

MovingBox can **only import CSV files that were previously exported from MovingBox**. The import feature is designed for:

- Restoring your own backups
- Transferring data between your devices
- Importing data you've previously exported

### What Cannot Be Imported

- Generic CSV files from other applications
- Spreadsheets created manually
- Exports from other inventory apps
- Modified CSV files (editing exported files may cause import errors)

<Tip>
  If you need to import data from another source, export a sample from MovingBox first to understand the required CSV format, then format your external data to match.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Import Failed or Incomplete">
    If your import fails or doesn't complete:

    - **Check file size**: Very large exports may take time to process
    - **Verify the file**: Ensure the ZIP file isn't corrupted
    - **Check available storage**: Make sure you have enough space for photos
    - **Try selective import**: Import data types separately (locations first, then items)
    - **Cancel and retry**: Use the cancel button and try again
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Missing Photos After Import">
    If photos are missing after import:

    - Verify photos were in the original export's `photos/` folder
    - Check that the ZIP file structure is intact
    - Ensure photo filenames match the CSV references
    - Confirm you have storage space available
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cannot Access Exported File">
    If you can't open or import your export:

    - Make sure the file has `.zip` extension
    - Verify file permissions if stored in cloud storage
    - Try downloading to local storage first
    - Check that the file isn't still being synced or uploaded
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Export Button Disabled">
    If you can't start an export:

    - Ensure at least one export option is enabled (Items, Locations, or Labels)
    - Check that you have data to export (can't export empty inventory)
    - Make sure another export isn't already in progress
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
