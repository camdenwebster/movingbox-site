## About MovingBox

MovingBox is an iOS application that uses artificial intelligence to transform the tedious process of home inventory management into a quick, effortless experience. The app allows users to simply take photos of their belongings, and our AI technology automatically identifies and catalogues items with detailed information.

## The Problem We Solve

Managing a home inventory is a task that most people know they should do but rarely complete. Without a proper inventory:

- Homeowners and renters risk insufficient insurance reimbursements after loss, theft, or damage
- Finding specific items among your possessions becomes time-consuming
- Moving becomes more stressful without a clear record of belongings
- The mental load of maintaining, organizing, and tracking possessions increases
